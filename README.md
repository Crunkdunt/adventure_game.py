# adventure_game.py
 A very simple beginning of a terminal, text based adventure game written in Python

Currently, i have added simple logic and a test class of player which creates a player bio based upon user input. The class representation is a string presenting the user input.

I will add classes for each area that the user enters. An item class will also need to be created, consisting of a name, type(as in sword, candle whatever) weight, damage, defense, any other item elements to be added. Will likely start simple with just attack and defence items along with potions. Should magic items have a magic bool? 

Consumables such as potions, food, drink will be added.
